### 2.8 Directory Structure

Use the following directory structure for your project:

```plaintext
icse2026_cloudens_ad/
├── conf/                # Configuration files (e.g., config.yaml)
├── src/                 # Source code files
├── data/
│   ├── massaged/        # Pivoted input data
│   ├── labels/          # Anomaly window labels
├── results/
│   ├── model_experiments/ # Experiment results

```

You can **create these directories** using the following shell script:

```bash
mkdir -p conf src data/massaged data/labels results/model_experiments trained_models
```


## 3 Data Source

## 5 Execution

### 5.1 Using Docker

#### 5.1.1 Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:
```bash
docker build -t anomaly-detector .
```

#### 5.1.2 Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -it anomaly-detector
```

### 5.2 Using Virtual Environment

The workflow is configured using the [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) framework.

#### Split the pivoted dataset into different feature subsets
The selected HTTP Status Codes and Aggregations can be configurable in the `config.yaml` file. 
Modify the following parameters under `data_preparation_pipeline`:
```yaml
data_preparation_pipeline:
  multiple_preprocessing: true # true or false
  feature_subsets:
    http_codes: ['5xx','4xx'] # http codes can be 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
    aggregations: ['count','avg','min','max']
    
  features_prep:
    filter:
      http_codes: ['5xx'] # http codes can be 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
      aggregations: ['count']
```
If `multiple_preprocessing: false`, the preprocessing script extracts and processes a single feature subset based on the 
specified HTTP status codes and aggregation method defined under `features_prep.filter` 
(`http_codes` and `aggregations`).

If set to `multiple_preprocessing: true`, the script generates multiple feature subsets by iterating over 
all combinations of `http_codes` and `aggregations` specified in `data_preparation_pipeline.feature_subsets`.

To extract feature subsets, preprocess them, and save the results to disk, run:
```bash
python src/run_preprocessing.py
```
This script will apply the preprocessing pipeline based on your configuration settings in `config.yaml`.

After preprocessing multiple feature subsets, the project directory will be organized as follows:
```plaintext
icse2026_cloudens_ad/
├── conf/                # Configuration files (e.g., config.yaml)
├── src/                 # Source code files
├── data/
│   ├── massaged/        # Pivoted input data
│   │   ├── extracted
│   │   │   ├── no_group_4xx_avg                # Feature subset folder according to 4xx (Status Code) and avg (Aggregation)
│   │   │   │   ├── adjacency_matrix.npy        # Adjacency matrix
│   │   │   │   ├── filtered_raw_data.parquet   # Processed data corresponding to feature subset
│   │   │   │   ├── meta_data.json              # Additional information about the graph representaion
│   │   │   ├── no_group_4xx_count
│   │   │   ├── ...  
│   ├── labels/          # Anomaly window labels
├── trained_models/      # Saved trained models
```
#### 5.2.1 Configuring the Base Model Architecture

The model type (e.g., A3T-GCN or GRU) is configurable in the `config.yaml` file. Modify the following parameters under `evaluation`:

```yaml
evaluation:
  retrain: false
  use_model: 'GRU' # 'A3TGCN' or 'GRU'
```

#### 5.2.2 Configuring NAB Scoring Profile

The NAB scoring profile used for evaluation can be configured in the `conf.yaml` file. Update the following parameters under the `evaluation` section:

```yaml
evaluation:  # Default parameters
  nab_scoring_profile: "reward_fn"  # Options: "standard" or "reward_fn"
```


#### 5.2.3 Run the Project
To run the project, execute the main script after setting up the required directories and input files:

```bash
python src/run_experiment__multi_models_GRU_ANN.py
```

Note that you can pass configuration parameters directly via the command line. For example:
```bash
python src/run_experiment__multi_models_GRU_ANN.py train_test_config.use_model=GRU evaluation.nab_scoring_profile=reward_fn  
```

## Notes for Replicability

- Use Python 3.12.2 to avoid compatibility issues.
- Keep the `requirements.txt` file up-to-date if new dependencies are added.
- Use the exact steps mentioned above to ensure a consistent environment across different setups.
